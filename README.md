# Getting_Cleaning_Data
## Introduction

An exciting area in data science is wearable computing. Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up were racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

## This script does the following:

* Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set;
* Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement;
* Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set;
* Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names;
* From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

## How to use
To get the results of this script you need just to run it on your machine without any manual downloadings.
